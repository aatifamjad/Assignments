    "Up-sampling refers to adding more instances to the minority class, while down-sampling refers to removing instances from the majority class.

For example, if a dataset has 90% instances in the majority class and 10% instances in the minority class, down-sampling can be used to reduce the majority class to 50% and up-sampling can be used to increase the minority class to 50%."
