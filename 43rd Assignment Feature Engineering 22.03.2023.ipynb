    "Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose\n",
    "you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam\n",

    "\n",
    " To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, you need to first calculate the covariance and the standard deviations of both variables. Once you have those values, you can use the formula for Pearson correlation coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = covariance / (standard deviation of variable 1 * standard deviation of variable 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the final exam scores also increase.\n",
    "If the coefficient is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship between the two variables. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the final exam scores decrease.\n",
    "If the coefficient is close to 0, it indicates no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",

    "Q2. Spearman's rank correlation is a measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables.\n",

    "variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer...\n",
    "\n",
    " To calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level, you need to rank both variables from lowest to highest. Once you have the ranks, you can use the formula for Spearman's rank correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "rs = 1 - (6 * sum of squared differences between ranks) / (n * (n^2 - 1))\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of the Spearman's rank correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive monotonic relationship between the two variables. This means that as the amount of sleep individuals get each night increases, their overall job satisfaction level also increases, regardless of the specific values.\n",
    "If the coefficient is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative monotonic relationship between the two variables. This means that as the amount of sleep individuals get each night increases, their overall job satisfaction level decreases, regardless of the specific values.\n",

    "Q3. Suppose you are conducting a study to examine the relationship between the number of hours of\n",
    "exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) in a sample of adults. You collected data on both variables\n",

    "between these two variables and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer...\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation between the number of hours of exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) in a sample of adults, you need to calculate both coefficients using the formulas described in Q1 and Q2. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between the two variables, while the Spearman's rank correlation measures the monotonic relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation are both close to 1 or -1, it suggests a strong linear or monotonic relationship, respectively. However, if the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 0 but the Spearman's rank correlation is close to 1 or -1, it suggests a non-linear but monotonic relationship.\n",

    "Q4. A researcher is interested in examining the relationship between the number of hours individuals\n",

    "these two variables.\n",

    "Answer...\n",
    "\n",
    " To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity, you need to use the formula described in Q1. A positive coefficient suggests that as the number of hours spent watching TV increases, the level of physical activity decreases, while a negative coefficient suggests the opposite.\n",

    "The table provides information on the relationship between age and preference for a particular brand of soft drink. It does not provide enough information to calculate a correlation coefficient, as it only shows the frequency of responses for each age group and preference category.\n",

    "Answer...\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of sales calls made per day and the number of sales made per week, you need to use the formula described in Q1. A positive coefficient suggests that as the number of sales calls made per day increases, the number of sales made per week also increases, while a negative coefficient suggests the opposite."
