    "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you\n",
    "might choose one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer...\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding is that Ordinal Encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category based on its rank or order, whereas Label Encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category without considering any order. For example, in Ordinal Encoding, \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\" might be encoded as 1, 2, and 3 respectively, based on their order, while in Label Encoding they might be encoded as 0, 1, and 2 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Ordinal Encoding is preferred when there is a natural order or hierarchy among the categories, such as in the case of \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\" mentioned above. On the other hand, Label Encoding is preferred when there is no natural order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in\n",
    "a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer...\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique that uses the target variable to assign ordinal values to each category of a categorical variable. It involves computing the mean of the target variable for each category and then encoding the categories based on their mean values in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset of customers and we want to predict whether they will buy a product or not. One of the features is \"Country\", with categories like \"USA\", \"UK\", \"India\", etc. We can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to encode these categories based on the mean rate of product purchase for each country. Countries with higher rates of product purchase will be assigned higher ordinal values, while countries with lower rates of product purchase will be assigned lower ordinal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful in situations where there is a strong relationship between the target variable and the categorical variable, and when there are too many categories to use One-Hot Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer...\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is a measure of how two variables are related to each other. It is important in statistical analysis because it can help identify relationships between variables and can be used to determine the strength and direction of those relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables vary together, or in other words, how much they co-vary. If two variables tend to increase or decrease together, they have a positive covariance, while if one variable tends to increase while the other decreases, they have a negative covariance. If the variables are independent, their covariance is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is calculated using the formula: cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X]) * (Y - E[Y])], where E[X] and E[Y] are the means of X and Y, respectively.\n",

    "Employment Status (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time): One-hot encoding, where each level is encoded as a separate binary variable (e.g., Unemployed=1 0 0, Part-Time=0 1 0, Full-Time=0 0 1). This encoding avoids the assumption of an ordinal relationship between the levels and allows for more flexibility in the machine learning model."
