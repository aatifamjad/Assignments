    "In Python, an Exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. It is usually caused by an error in the program, such as a division by zero, an out-of-bounds access to a list, or the use of an undefined variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions allow you to handle errors in a controlled and graceful manner, instead of abruptly terminating your program. You can use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and take appropriate action to resolve the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Syntax errors are errors in the code that prevent the program from being executed. They occur when the code does not follow the rules of the Python syntax. For example, a missing colon, mismatched parentheses, or an incorrect indentation can result in a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, syntax errors are compile-time errors and exceptions are runtime errors. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all, while exceptions allow the program to continue running and gracefully handle the error when it occurs."
