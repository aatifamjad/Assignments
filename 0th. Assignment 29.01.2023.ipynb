    "Memory in Python is managed by the Python Memory Manager. The Python Memory Manager is responsible for allocating and freeing memory, as well as handling memory fragmentation. The Memory Manager uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of the number of references to each object in memory. When the reference count for an object reaches zero, the Memory Manager frees the memory occupied by the object. Additionally, the Memory Manager periodically runs a garbage collector to identify and reclaim objects that are no longer being used. The garbage collector uses a technique called cycle detection to identify objects that are involved in reference cycles, and frees the memory occupied by those objects.\n"
