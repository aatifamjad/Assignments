    "\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that maps each possible value of a discrete random variable to its probability of occurrence. For example, the PMF of rolling a fair six-sided die would be: P(X = 1) = 1/6, P(X = 2) = 1/6, P(X = 3) = 1/6, P(X = 4) = 1/6, P(X = 5) = 1/6, P(X = 6) = 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that maps each possible value of a continuous random variable to the density of the probability distribution at that point. For example, the PDF of the normal distribution is given by the formula: f(x) = (1/σ√(2π)) * e^-(x-μ)^2/(2σ^2), where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the distribution.\n",

    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) gives the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a given value x, i.e., F(x) = P(X ≤ x). For example, the CDF of the normal distribution can be calculated using a standard normal table or a statistical software. The CDF is used to find probabilities of a range of values, and also to calculate percentiles and other descriptive statistics.\n",

    "Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model?\n",
    "Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is used as a model in many situations where the variable of interest is continuous and has a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution. Examples include heights and weights of people, IQ scores, exam scores, reaction times, and many other natural phenomena. The parameters of the normal distribution, namely the mean and standard deviation, determine the location and spread of the distribution.\n",

    "Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Normal Distribution is important in statistics because it is a common model for many naturally occurring phenomena. Real-life examples include the distribution of heights and weights of people, the distribution of IQ scores, and the distribution of exam scores. The Normal Distribution is also important because of the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum or average of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables tends to follow a normal distribution.\n",

    "Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli\n",
    "Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli Distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models a binary outcome, i.e., an event that can have only two possible outcomes, such as success or failure, heads or tails, or yes or no. An example of Bernoulli Distribution is the probability of flipping a fair coin and getting heads, which is p=0.5 for a fair coin. The main difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution is that the latter models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",

    "Q6. Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset\n",
    "is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater\n",
    "than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability that a randomly selected observation from a normal distribution with mean μ=50 and standard deviation σ=10 is greater than 60, we can use the formula for the standard normal distribution and the z-score transformation: P(X > 60) = P(Z > (60-50)/10) = P(Z > 1) = 0.1587, where Z is a standard normal random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Therefore, the probability is 0.1587 or 15.87%.\n",

    "Answer 7) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Uniform Distribution is a continuous probability distribution that models a situation where all outcomes in a given interval are equally likely. An example of Uniform Distribution is the probability of picking a number between 1 and 10, where each number has the same probability of being chosen. The probability density function of the uniform distribution is f(x) = 1/(b-a) for a ≤ x ≤ b\n",

    "Q8: What is the z score? State the importance of the z score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "The z score, also known as the standard score, is a statistical measure that indicates how many standard deviations an observation or data point is above or below the mean of the data set. It is calculated as the difference between the observed value and the mean of the population, divided by the standard deviation of the population. The z score is important because it helps in standardizing different variables with different units of measurement, making it easier to compare them. It is also used to determine the probability of an observation occurring within a given range of values.\n",

    "Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a statistical theory that states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. This means that if we take a large number of random samples from a population, the means of those samples will tend to cluster around the population mean, with a standard deviation equal to the standard error of the mean. The significance of the CLT is that it provides a basis for making statistical inferences about a population from a sample, even when the population distribution is unknown or not normal.\n",

    "Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem makes certain assumptions about the sample and the population. These assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Random sampling: The sample is randomly selected from the population, so that each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Independent observations: Each observation in the sample is independent of the others, meaning that the value of one observation does not affect the value of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Finite population or infinite population with replacement: The population from which the sample is drawn is either finite or infinite, but if it is infinite, the sample is drawn with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Sample size: The sample size is sufficiently large (usually n ≥ 30) to ensure that the sample means are normally distributed."
