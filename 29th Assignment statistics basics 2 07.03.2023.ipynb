    "\n",
    "Answer 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The three measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the\n",
    "central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. Median is the middle value in an ordered dataset. Mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. These measures are used to provide a central value that represents the typical value of the dataset.\n",

    "Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data:\n",
    "[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: 176.9375, Median: 177, Mode: 178. The mean is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the total number of values. The median is found by arranging the values in order and selecting the middle value. The mode is the most frequently occurring value.\n",

    "Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:\n",
    "[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 4) \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation for the given data is approximately 2.408. The formula for calculating standard deviation is complex and involves calculating the difference between each value and the mean, squaring the differences, summing the squares, dividing by the number of values minus one, and then taking the square root of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe\n",
    "the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. The variance is the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. These measures help to provide a more complete understanding of the dataset beyond the central tendency measures.\n",

    "Q6. What is a Venn diagram?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 6)\n",
    "\n",
    ". A Venn diagram is a graphical representation of sets using overlapping circles. The circles represent the sets and the overlapping regions represent the elements that are in both sets.\n",

    "Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness in data refers to the degree of asymmetry of the dataset. If the dataset is skewed, it means that it does not have a symmetrical distribution, and one tail may be longer than the other. Skewness can affect the measures of central tendency and dispersion.\n",

    "Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a dataset is right skewed, the median will be less than the mean.\n",

    "Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in\n",
    "statistical analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Covariance measures the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation measures the degree to which two variables are related to each other. Correlation takes the values between -1 and 1, whereas covariance can take any value. These measures are used to identify the relationship between two variables and to make predictions.\n",

    " Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a\n",
    "dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 11) The formula for calculating the sample mean is:\n",
    "\n",
    "mean = (sum of values) / (number of values)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a dataset has values 2, 4, 6, and 8, the mean would be (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) / 4 = 5.\n",

    "Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 12)\n",
    "\n",
    " For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal.\n",

    "Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 13)\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation measures the degree to which two variables are related to each other, but it also standardizes the measure to be between -1 and 1, making it easier to interpret and compare.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 14)\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion. If an outlier is much higher or lower than the other values, it can increase or decrease the mean and affect the median and mode. Outliers can also increase the range, variance, and standard deviation, making the dataset appear more spread out than it actually is. For example, if a dataset has values 2, 4, 6, 8, and 100, the mean would be"
