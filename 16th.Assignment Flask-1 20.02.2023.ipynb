    "Flask is a popular web framework for building web applications in Python. It is a lightweight framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. Flask was originally released in 2010 and has since grown in popularity due to its simplicity and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Lightweight and easy to use: Flask is a lightweight framework that is easy to learn and use. It has a simple syntax and minimal setup, which makes it an ideal choice for beginners and small projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Flexibility: Flask is a very flexible framework that allows developers to choose the tools and libraries they want to use. It doesn't force developers to use any particular way of doing things, which means they can choose the best approach for their particular use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Extensibility: Flask is easily extensible through the use of plugins and extensions. It has a large and active community that has developed many useful extensions for Flask, such as Flask-RESTful, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Login.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Testability: Flask makes it easy to write and run tests for web applications. It has a built-in test client that allows developers to simulate requests to their application, which makes testing faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Scalability: Flask is scalable and can be used to build large-scale web applications. It has a simple and modular structure that makes it easy to add new features and functionality as the application grows.\n",
