    "GET and POST are two HTTP request methods used to communicate with web servers to retrieve or send data, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "GET method:\n",
    "The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource on a web server. When you enter a URL in your web browser, the browser sends a GET request to the web server to retrieve the content associated with that URL. The data is sent as part of the URL, in the form of query parameters, and is visible in the address bar of the browser. GET requests are considered \"safe\" and \"idempotent,\" which means that they can be repeated without causing any harm or side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST method:\n",
    "The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource on a web server. Unlike GET requests, the data submitted in a POST request is not visible in the URL or address bar of the browser. Instead, it is sent in the message body of the request. POST requests are typically used for actions that modify data on the server, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources. They are not considered \"safe\" or \"idempotent,\" because repeating the same request multiple times can result in unintended changes to the server's data."

    "In Flask, the request object is used to represent the HTTP request made by a client to the server.

    "\n",
    "The request object in Flask allows you to access information about the request, such as the HTTP method (e.g., GET or POST), the URL that was requested, and any data that was sent as part of the request. You can also use the request object to retrieve user input from forms, files, or other data sent as part of the request.\n",
    "\n",

    "In Flask, a template is a file that defines the structure and content of a web page, and allows you to dynamically generate HTML pages by inserting data into the template. Templates provide a way to separate the presentation logic from the application logic, making it easier to maintain and modify the appearance of a web application without affecting the underlying code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates in Flask are typically written in a markup language like HTML, and can contain placeholders for dynamic data that is passed in from the application. For example, a template might contain a placeholder for a user's name, which would be replaced with the actual user's name at runtime.\n",

You can then use the render_template() function to render the template and pass in any necessary data.
