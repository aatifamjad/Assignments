    "The main difference between a t-test and a z-test is the way they handle the population variance. A t-test is used when the population variance is unknown and is estimated from the sample data, while a z-test is used when the population variance is known or when the sample size is large enough that the sample variance is a good estimate of the population variance. For example, if we want to compare the mean height of two groups of people, we might use a t-test if we don't know the population variance or a z-test if we have data on the population variance."
